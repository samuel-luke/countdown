## Numbers round

The numbers round consists of six numbers, some "large" and some "small". The contestants decide how many of each they would like, and then a target number is randomly generated. The contestants must then use the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get as close to the target number as possible. They may only use each number drawn once and do not have to use all six.
