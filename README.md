    Created by Samuel Luke

Countdown is a British game show involving word and number tasks.

## Letters round

The letters round consists of nine randomly drawn letters, of which each contestant must rearrange to create a valid English word. 

Usage: python letters.py

Then follow the prompts by typing all drawn letters and pressing enter. The program will try every possible combination and display every legitimate word in the dictionary. 

**Disclaimer:** In the show, they use the Oxford English dictionary, as this program uses an open source word list, the same words are not guaranteed. 

## Numbers round

The numbers round consists of six numbers, some "large" and some "small". The contestants decide how many of each they would like, and then a target number is randomly generated. The contestants must then use the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get as close to the target number as possible. They may only use each number drawn once and do not have to use all six.

Usage: python numbers.py

Then follow the prompts by entering one drawn number per line, followed by the goal you mean to reach. The program will output all found ways to get to the goal.
